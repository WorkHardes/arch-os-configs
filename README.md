# My fav arch configs

This repo contains several scripts of my arch linux configuration:

Configure it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WorkHardes/arch-os-configs
cd ./arch-os-configs

sudo ./pacman-install.sh
./yay-install.sh
./set-configs.sh
```

- [pacman-install](./pacman-install.sh)
  Must be executed first and as root

- [yay-install](./yay-install.sh)
  Must be executed after pacman-install.sh

- [set-configs](./set-configs.sh)
  Must be executed after yay-install.sh

**Configurations for obsidian and vs-code are located in the corresponding folders**
